### Key Classes and Concepts

1. **ControlAffineSystem** (`systems/control_affine_system.py`): Base class for all dynamical systems. Systems must implement:
   - `_f(x)` - Drift dynamics
   - `_g(x)` - Control input matrix
   - `safe_mask()`, `unsafe_mask()`, `goal_mask()` - Region definitions
   - `state_limits`, `control_limits` - System constraints

2. **NeuralCLBFController** (`controllers/neural_clbf_controller.py`): Main controller that:
   - Learns a neural network certificate function V(x)
   - Ensures V(goal) = 0, V(safe) < c, V(unsafe) > c
   - Guarantees dV/dt <= -λV for stability

3. **Training Flow**:
   - Define system → Configure scenarios → Set up datamodule → Train controller → Evaluate

### Adding New Systems

To implement a new control problem:
1. Create a subclass of `ControlAffineSystem` in `systems/`
2. Implement required methods: `_f`, `_g`, region masks, limits
3. Create training script in `training/` (copy from existing example)
4. Configure scenarios for robust control training

### QP Solvers

- Default: CVXPy (free, supports backpropagation for training)
- Optional: Gurobi (faster evaluation, requires academic/commercial license)
- Set `disable_gurobi=False` to enable Gurobi for paper reproduction

### External Dependencies

**F16 Model**: For F16 experiments, clone and install AeroBenchVVPython:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:dawsonc/AeroBenchVVPython.git
# Then update path in neural_clbf/setup/aerobench.py
```

## Project-Specific Instructions

### Current Task: Neural Control Barrier Function (NCBF) for Unicycle Collision Avoidance

**Status**: ✅ **TRAINING PHASE COMPLETED - READY FOR CONTROL INTEGRATION**

**Training Achievement**: Successfully trained large-scale Neural CBF with 111,553 parameters, achieving 90.1% safe classification accuracy and comprehensive visualization with gradient flow maps.

**Objective**: Implement a pure Neural CBF (NOT CLBF) for unicycle collision avoidance - safety certification only, no goal-reaching or stability components.

**Key Distinction**:
- **Neural CBF Only**: Learn h(x) neural network for safety certification only
- **No CLBF Components**: No Lyapunov functions, no goal-reaching integration
- **No Goal Mask**: CBF learning is isolated from navigation objectives
- **Pure Safety Focus**: h(x) distinguishes safe from unsafe states only

**Major Achievement**: Successfully resolved the fundamental underactuated system navigation issue using virtual transformation matrix approach, achieving 90-100% navigation success rate with 90-100% safety rate across multiple random scenarios.

**Reference Materials**:
- `/reference/mcode/carModel.m` - MATLAB unicycle model with R-CBF implementation
- `/reference/papers/Dawson 等 - 2023 - Safe Control With Learned Certificates A Survey o.pdf` - Primary reference for NCBF theory
- `/reference/papers/castaneda23a.pdf` - Advanced work (future plan, uses image inputs)

### NCBF Definitions and Notation

**Neural Control Barrier Function h(x)**:
- Learned neural network function h(x) that serves as safety certificate
- **Safety condition**: h(x) ≥ 0 for safe regions, h(x) < 0 for unsafe states
- **Time derivative condition**: dh/dt ≥ -αh where α > 0 is a positive parameter
- This ensures forward invariance of safe set (if h(x(0)) ≥ 0, then h(x(t)) ≥ 0 ∀t ≥ 0)

**System Dynamics** (Unicycle Model):
- State: x = [px, py, θ] (position and orientation)
- Control: u = [v, ω] (linear velocity and angular velocity)
- Dynamics: pẋ = v cos(θ), pẏ = v sin(θ), θ̇ = ω

### Implementation Plan

1. **Create Unicycle System** in `/work/unicycle.py`:
   - Subclass ControlAffineSystem
   - Implement _f(x) and _g(x) methods for unicycle dynamics
   - Define safe_mask(), unsafe_mask() for collision avoidance (no goal_mask needed)
   - Set state_limits and control_limits
   - **CRITICAL**: Add transformation matrix method for underactuated-to-fully-actuated conversion

2. **Setup Collision Avoidance**:
   - Define circular obstacles in environment
   - Create barrier functions that maintain safe distance from obstacles
   - Implement multiple obstacle handling
   - **KEY INSIGHT**: Use transformation matrix to handle underactuated constraints properly

3. **Training Configuration**:
   - Create training script in `/work/train_unicycle.py`
   - Configure scenarios for robust training
   - Set up data generation for state space coverage

4. **Evaluation and Visualization**:
   - Implement trajectory plotting with obstacles
   - Add safety verification tools
   - Compare with baseline controllers

### Virtual Transformation Approach for Underactuated Systems

**Problem Solved**: Unicycle systems are underactuated (control: [v, ω]) but CBF constraints need to be applied as if the system were fully actuated.

**Key Insight**: By using transformation matrix M, we control a virtual point ahead of the unicycle center, making the system behave as if it were fully actuated in constraint space.

**Mathematical Foundation**:
- **Underactuated Control**: u = [v, ω] (linear velocity, angular velocity)
- **Virtual Control**: [vx, vy, vω] = M * [v, ω] where M transforms to virtual velocities
- **Transformation Matrix**: M = [[cos(θ), -D*sin(θ)], [sin(θ), D*cos(θ)], [0, 1]]
- **Virtual Point**: Point D meters ahead of robot center, where D is a design parameter

**Why This Works**:
1. **Constraint Application**: CBF constraints L_g h·u ≥ b are computed in virtual space
2. **Physical Interpretation**: We're controlling a point ahead of the robot, giving us more "leverage" for constraint satisfaction
3. **Mathematical Soundness**: Follows established MATLAB carModel.m implementation pattern
4. **Constraint Satisfaction**: Virtual point provides additional degrees of freedom for satisfying safety constraints

**Implementation Details**:
- `get_transformation_matrix(x)` method in UnicycleModel returns proper 3×2 matrix
- CBF filter uses virtual dynamics for Lie derivative computation: L_g_virtual h = ∇h·M
- Analytical QP solution handles weighted norm MᵀM for proper constraint formulation
- Control constraints still applied through unicycle's `update_state` method (norm truncation)

**Benefits Achieved**:
- **Navigation Success**: 90-100% success rate across random scenarios
- **Safety Maintained**: 90-100% safety rate with proper CBF constraint enforcement
- **Rare Edge Cases**: Occasional collisions (<10%) due to control norm truncation in tight spaces
- **Practical Reliability**: System works reliably for most navigation scenarios

### Neural CBF Loss Function Design

**Total Loss:**
```
L_total = λ₁ * L_classification + λ₂ * L_barrier + λ₃ * L_reg
```

**1. Classification Loss (Primary):**
```
L_classification = max(0, -h(x_safe) + margin) + max(0, h(x_unsafe) + margin)
```
- h(x_safe) should be ≥ margin (e.g., margin = 0.3)
- h(x_unsafe) should be ≤ -margin
- Uses hinge loss for clear safe/unsafe separation

**2. Barrier Derivative Loss (Safety Enforcement):**
```
L_barrier = max(0, -max_u{dh/dt} - α*h(x))
```
- **Key insight**: max_u{dh/dt} = ∇h(x)·f(x) + u_max*||∇h(x)·g(x)||
- Ensures existence of safe control (not all controls are safe)
- α > 0 is barrier parameter (e.g., α = 0.3)

**3. SDF Regularization Loss (Optional):**
```
L_reg = ||∇h(x)||²  # Modified to make ||∇h(x)|| ≈ 1 for SDF-like behavior
```
**Key Modification**: Regularization encourages ||∇h(x)|| ≈ 1 rather than just minimizing gradient magnitude, making h(x) behave like a Signed Distance Function for better geometric properties.

### NCBF Implementation Technical Details

**Core Approach**: Learn safety certificates h(x) from data using MLP with virtual transformation for underactuated systems.

**Key Components** (kept simple for implementation):

**1. Map System**: Type 2 moderate density - 8 obstacles, 8×8m workspace, radius [0.15, 0.30]m

**2. Data Generation**:
- 50% uniform sampling + 50% Gaussian around obstacles
- 10,000 samples for quick testing
- Simple threshold labeling (safe/unsafe/boundary)

**3. Neural Network**: MLP with tunable layers and hidden size
- **Architecture**: Configurable layers [64, 64, 32] → 1
- **Input**: 3D state [px, py, θ]
- **Output**: 1D h(x) value
- **Activation**: Tunable (ReLU, tanh, sigmoid)
- **Flexible**: Adjustable layer count and hidden sizes

**4. Loss Functions** (Original CBF formulation):
- **Classification**: max(0, margin - h_safe) + max(0, margin + h_unsafe)
- **Barrier Derivative**: max(0, -max_u{dh/dt} - α*h(x)) (original formulation)
- **SDF Regularization**: ||∇h|| ≈ 1 (modified from basic smoothness)

**5. Training Config** (combined):
- Batch: 256, LR: 1e-3, Epochs: 50
- Margin: 0.3, Alpha: 0.5
- Network: Tunable layers, hidden sizes, activation functions

**6. Validation**: Direct comparison with handwritten CBF on same scenarios

**File Structure**: `/work/ncbf/` with maps/, training/, models/, configs/, weights/ directories

**Success Criteria**: >90% classification accuracy, positive correlation with handwritten CBF, maintains safety guarantees.

**Hyperparameters (Simple Start):**
- λ₁ = 1.0, λ₂ = 0.1-1.0, λ₃ = 0.01
- margin = 0.3, α = 0.3, u_max = 1.0

### Development Environment

### Data Generation Strategy

**Pure State Space Sampling (No Trajectories Needed):**
```python
# Uniform sampling in bounded region
px ~ Uniform(-5, 5), py ~ Uniform(-5, 5), θ ~ Uniform(-π, π)

# Automatic safety labeling based on obstacle distances
def label_state(x, obstacles, safety_radius=0.5, buffer=0.1):
    min_dist = min_distance_to_obstacles(x, obstacles)
    if min_dist > safety_radius + buffer: return "safe"
    elif min_dist < safety_radius - buffer: return "unsafe"
    else: return "boundary"
```

**Sampling Strategy:**
- 50% uniform sampling for state space coverage
- 50% obstacle-focused sampling (Gaussian around obstacles) for boundary refinement
- Generate 10k-100k samples in seconds (no integration required)

**Advantages:**
- **No trajectory generation**: Direct state evaluation
- **Instant labeling**: Distance-based classification
- **Parallel processing**: Efficient batch computation
- **Theoretical soundness**: Closed-form optimal control enables pure sampling

### Key Implementation Notes

- Use the existing TurtleBot system as reference (similar unicycle dynamics)
- Implement pure CBF using clean, self-contained code (implementation details TBD)
- **No Lyapunov components**: Focus only on h(x) barrier function learning
- **No goal integration**: CBF training is completely separate from navigation
- Ensure proper barrier function constraints during training
- Validate safety guarantees through simulation

### Neural CBF vs CLBF Clarification

**This project implements Neural CBF ONLY:**
- Learn h(x) neural network for safety certification
- h(x) ≥ 0: safe states, h(x) < 0: unsafe states
- Training loss enforces safety conditions only
- No stability or goal-reaching objectives mixed in

**NOT implementing Neural CLBF:**
- No Lyapunov function V(x) learning
- No stability guarantees (dV/dt ≤ -λV)
- No goal set conditions (V(goal) = 0)
- No combined barrier+Lyapunov objectives

## Future Work

### Image-Based NCBF (Following Castaneda's Approach)
If the current unicycle NCBF implementation is successful, the next phase will implement image-based NCBF learning in latent space:

1. **Vision-Based Perception**:
   - Use camera/radar/LiDAR inputs instead of state measurements
   - Follow Castaneda et al.'s approach for learning NCBF directly from images
   - Implement encoder-decoder architecture for latent space learning

2. **Latent Space NCBF**:
   - Learn h(x) in compressed latent representation
   - Handle high-dimensional sensory inputs efficiently
   - Enable deployment on real robotic systems with vision sensors

3. **End-to-End Learning**:
   - Direct mapping from sensory inputs to safe control actions
   - Eliminate need for explicit state estimation
   - Robust to sensor noise and partial observations

This future work builds on the foundational unicycle NCBF implementation and moves toward more practical, sensor-based safety systems.

### Control Constraint Refinement (Current System Enhancement)
**Status**: Successfully implemented and validated, with rare edge cases identified

**Current Achievement**: The transformation matrix approach successfully resolves underactuated system navigation with 90-100% success rate and 90-100% safety rate.

**Rare Edge Cases**: Occasional collisions (<10%) occur due to control norm truncation when CBF constraints become extremely tight (h(x) → 0). This happens when:
- Robot gets trapped in very tight spaces between obstacles
- Safety filter produces very large control values that get truncated by update_state
- CBF constraint becomes mathematically too restrictive near obstacle boundaries

**Future Enhancement**:
- Implement adaptive CBF parameters that relax constraints slightly in tight spaces
- Use reference governor approach to modify target rather than control directly
- Implement multi-stage CBF with different constraint tightness levels
- Add recovery mechanisms for trapped states (small random perturbations, backtracking)

**Priority**: Low - Current system works reliably for practical applications, rare edge cases are acceptable for most use cases.

- Add new tests: Extend testing framework with additional scenarios

This architecture creates a general CBF framework that evolves from handwritten CBFs to learned NCBFs while maintaining clean separation between system dynamics, control design, and safety certification.

## Technical Decisions for 3-Day Implementation

**QP Solver**: CVXPy selected - license-free, supports backpropagation, sufficient for demo purposes. Avoids Gurobi setup complexity.

**GPU Resources**: RTX 4060 (7.7GB VRAM) accepted as adequate for simple NCBF demo. Will monitor batch sizes and network complexity accordingly.

**Environment Strategy**: Self-contained 3-day implementation, independent of existing neural_clbf conda environment. Reference materials used only for conceptual guidance, not code dependency.

## Important Notes

- This is research-grade code, not production-ready
- The codebase may contain outdated dependencies
- Safety guarantees are theoretical - always validate on your specific system
- For production applications, consult with the REALM lab researchers
- always try to test if a block of code is changed/added, add testing process as much as possible to guarantee the reliability of the code
- never be in a hurry to finish the todo, always ask the user can we go to the next step
- this is a 3-day project and we should keep it simple for robustness
- put test files in /test dir
- when a package is not installed, first check if you are using conada env latentSafety
- when generating test files, put put them to /test dir
- when error writing code or error update code, try again and give the user a warning
